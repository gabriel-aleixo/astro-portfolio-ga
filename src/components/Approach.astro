    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>
        I am 100% hands-on - I can do the design, coding, run user testing,
        refine products based on data, or lead product and tech teams through
        these steps.

            <h3>Research First</h3>
            <p>
                My background in market research and strategy allows me (or
                rather forces me!) to interrogate each and every assumption or
                feature to determine if they'll help move the product forward.
                Everything starts with understanding your users behaviors.

            <h3>Iterate & Test</h3>
            <p>
                I believe in making informed assumptions and testing them as
                quickly and cheaply as possible. Prioritize learning. Focus on
                the upcoming sprint rather than the next quarter or next year.

            <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
            <p>
                Start small and stay flexible. Over-engineering early on can
                lead to missed opportunities (sunken cost fallacy is a thing!).
                I tend to use proven, scalable, yet simple solutions to build
                only what's essential.
