It’s awesome to think that I’ve been back in the Dungeon Master’s chair for a year now. At the beginning of 2024, returning to steady DMing was one of my personal goals, and I'm happy to see that I did it. I ran a bit more than 30 sessions and tried three other RPG systems in addition to D&D 5e.

When I started running my current D&Dcampaign, I had no grand plan. Honestly, it was more like, “Here’s a couple of one-shots—let’s see what happens.” And yet, somehow, it evolved into a sprawling story with level-nine characters, multiple arcs, and more lore than I can keep track of.  

As I look ahead to 2025, I’m realizing there are a few things I’d like to do differently. Not because the game hasn’t been fun—quite the opposite—but because I want to streamline things to run even more games! So here’s where my head is at as I think about the future of my games.  

### A Steady Schedule (for My Sanity)  

I’m the kind of person who likes to keep things flexible. I’ve always thought that being accommodating—letting schedules stay fluid—was the “nice” thing to do. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned this year, it’s that flexibility comes at a cost. Namely, my sanity.  

Trying to coordinate six adults’ schedules every week is like herding blink dogs, except the they also have jobs, kids, and other hobbies. So this year, I’m hoping to lock in a more consistent schedule: game night is game night. If someone can’t make it, they skip the session, and we carry on. No more endless back-and-forth in the group chat. Hopefully, fewer Whatsapp polls. Just more time spent actually playing the game, and less time wishing we did.  

### Let’s Talk About Character Arcs  

I love it when players share their character backstories with me. I really do. But let’s be honest—sometimes it’s a lot. A 10-page backstory is great in theory, but it also comes with the expectation that I’ll somehow integrate all of it into the campaign. And while I’d love to tie every NPC and plot twist back to a player’s tragic orphan origin story, I only have so much bandwidth.  
This year, I’m hoping to shift some of that responsibility to the players. If they’ve got ideas for how their backstory could tie into the campaign, I want them to tell me. If they think an NPC might secretly be their long-lost sibling, or that a dungeon might contain an artifact from their past, I’m all ears. The more collaborative this process is, the better. After all, this isn’t my story—it’s ours.  

### Wrapping Up the Current Campaign  

Building this campaign has been a wild ride for me, but it’s also starting to feel like it’s outgrown its foundations. When we started, the characters were running errands for a local village council. Now, they’re level-nine adventurers travelling to hell and fighting demon lords. And while I love how the story has evolved, I can’t ignore the fact that the world I’ve built is starting to show cracks.

I also may have been too ambitous mixing up several sources and styles from the beginning, and this may have diluted the overall feel of the campaign. Retconning and figuring out lore on the fly, improvising backstory connections has been fun(ish...), but it’s time to bring this chapter to a close.

The current arc is shaping up to be a nice way to tie everything together — fitting, since it’s one of the few ideas I already had in my mind when we first started this campaign, inspired by the wonderful Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach Series. After that, I’m excited to start fresh in an established setting. Eberron is at the top of my list, but I’m open to suggestions. Either way, I’m looking forward to working within a framework of established lore—it feels like a good creative challenge.  

### Keeping Everyone Engaged  

One thing I’ve noticed this year is that not every story arc clicks with every player. And that’s fine—it’s impossible to please everyone all the time. But what I’d really like to avoid is players disengaging and withdrawing without saying anything.  

So my goal for 2025 is to create a space where players feel comfortable speaking up. If they’re not enjoying a particular arc, I want them to tell me. That way, we can manage expectations together—whether that means speeding up the current storyline or promising that something new is just around the corner.

### Trying New Adventure Styles  

One of my favorite things about DMing this year has been experimenting with different types of adventures. We’ve done heists, wilderness exploration, dungeon crawls, split-the-party sessions—and each one has challenged me and the players in different ways.

In 2025, I want to keep pushing those boundaries. Maybe I’ll try a political intrigue arc or a full-on survival scenario. Maybe we’ll dive into a mystery-heavy plot or something completely unexpected. The beauty of D&D is that there’s always something new to try, and I’m excited to see where it takes us.  

## Final Thoughts  

So that’s where I’m at as I head into 2025. A steadier schedule, more collaborative character arcs, a satisfying end to the current campaign, and kicking off a new one in a new setting, using 2024 rules. Let's see how well this post ages in a year!
