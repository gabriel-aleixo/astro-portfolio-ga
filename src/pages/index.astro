		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>
			I'm Gabriel Aleixo, a product consultant and software developer with over 20 years of experience 
			helping brands and startups turn ideas into reality. From managing digital marketing for global 
			brands like NIVEA and Philips, to building MVPs for early-stage startups, I bring a mix of 
			technical development, user insights, and market research expertise to the table.
		</p>
		<p>
			I specialize in product development with a hands-on approach: coding prototypes, testing them 
			with real users, and refining based on data. I'm also skilled at A/B testing, idea validation, 
			and agile development, ensuring every feature I build meets actual market needs.
